class Patch:
    """Class representing a patch of sss_meas_data.
    Note that index 0 denotes the first ping collected, i.e. the patch should be viewed as the data
    collected when the AUV traverses down from the top of the image.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patch_id: int
        Unique id for the SSSPatch.
    file_id: str
        The file id of the original sss_meas_data from which the SSSPatch is created.
    filename: str
        The name of the sss_meas_data file from which the patch is extracted.
    start_ping: int
        The start ping index of the sss patch from the sss_meas_data
    end_ping: int
        The end ping index of the sss patch from the sss_meas_data
    start_bin: int
        The start bin index of the sss patch from the sss_meas_data
    end_bin: int
        The end bin index of the sss patch from the sss_meas_data
    pos: np.array
        The AUV's dead-reckoning 3D positions when collecting each ping in the patch.
        shape = (self.length, 3)
    rpy: np.array
        The AUV's roll, pitch and yaw when collecting each ping in the the patch.
        shape = (self.length, 3)
    sss_waterfall_image: np.array
        The waterfall image constructed by stacking the hit intensities of the sss pings included in
        the patch vertically. This corresponds to a segment of sss_waterfall_image in the original
        sss_meas_data.
        shape = (self.length, self.width)
    sss_hits: np.array
        The positions where each sss ping hits the mesh. This corresponds to a segment of the
        stacked (sss_waterfall_hits_X, sss_waterfall_hits_Y, sss_waterfall_hits_Z) in the original
        sss_meas_data.
        shape = (self.length, self.width, 3)
    is_port: bool
        True if the patch is extracted from the port side, False if it is from the starboard side
    annotated_keypoints: dict
        A dictionary of keypoint hahshes whose locations fall into the patch.
        The dictionary has the following structure:
            {keypoint hash: {"pos": (ping_idx, bin_idx), "annotation_file": path to the annotation
            file containing this keypoint}
        Note that the keypoint position in "pos" are given in the index of the patch.
        i.e. for a keypoint with (ping_idx, bin_idx), the same keypoint is found in the original
        sss_meas_data at (ping_idx+start_ping, bin_idx + start_bin)
